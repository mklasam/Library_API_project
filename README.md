# Library_API_project ðŸ“š

# Introduction ðŸ“–
This API is prepared as a final project for the "Programowanie Ruby" subject. 
It presents a library simulation and includes functions like seeing the exact book or all the books in the library, adding, deleting and updating them.
All of the books include an unique id so we can easily make changes on them.
